Just walked out of that chaotic hurricane of a  , Riff Raff. My head’s kinda swimming. The theater was too loud, maybe didn’t notice cuz the popcorn was louder and my back’s been protesting since the first fight scene. You know, that feeling when you step out into the real world but it feels less real than the screen you just came from?

So this Riff Raff thing, it’s like... a mosh pit turned into a roller coaster. Faces blending into one another, you know, like when you stare at a stained glass window for too long and the outline melts away. Man, that opening scene, it was like a brick through a window—smashing expectations. Wait, did we talk about 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 this to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 later? I can't remember. You should tho... just to catch the bits you miss when wiping popcorn butter off your fingers.

> The part where she... or he, whoever that character was, jumped off the bridge, all dramatic and gutsy, had me thinking of jumping off into a pool full of grapes (or nonsense)... maybe it was the noise, but still... say what you will, but that had my heart jumping rope. Or something similar.

Some characters just echo, like, there's this buzzing — a fly you can't swat away, but they're there, persistent and stubborn. Mixing that sheer chaos with tender moments? Like squeezing a cactus and getting lemonade. Are those two things connected? Probably not, but thoughts are a labyrinth right now.

Some glitchy scene near the end had me questioning my reality — or was it just my dodgy theater seat that felt like an old washing machine on the spin cycle? And their dialogues were like... I dunno, a drunken debate at a midnight diner with soggy fries. Gripping and annoying all at once. Bet you wanna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 this just to pause and ponder over those lines. Yeah, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . Might as well.

Why is it so damp in here? Seriously, does sticky soda-air mess with brain signals or something? 🤔 

function brainDump(fragments) { 
  try { 
    console.log(fragments.join(' ')); // attempt to make sense 
  } catch(err) { 
    // whoops, we broke the review again 
  } 
}
